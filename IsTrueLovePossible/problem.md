# Problem: Is True Love Possible?

Manoj is preparing for placements and has feelings for Lolo. He is emotionally affected by:
1. The **advice** he gets from friends (some positive, some negative).
2. His **readiness for placement**, measured as a percentage (0–100).
3. Whether Lolo is **placed in a good company**.
4. Whether Lolo has **feelings for him**.

Manoj needs your help to determine if **True Love is Possible**, or if he should just **Try Again** or face a **CutGya moment**.

---

### Input:
- `advice`: A list of integers, where:
  - `1` means positive advice, `-1` means negative advice, and `0` means neutral advice.
- `readinessScore`: An integer (0–100) representing Manoj's readiness.
- `isLoloPlaced`: A boolean (`true` if Lolo is placed in a good company, otherwise `false`).
- `hasFeelingsFromLolo`: A boolean (`true` if Lolo has feelings for Manoj, otherwise `false`).

---

### Output:
- `"TrueLove"` if Manoj meets all criteria:
  1. Emotional balance is high (advice is mostly positive).
  2. Readiness score is **80 or above**.
  3. Lolo has feelings for Manoj.

- `"CutGya"` if:
  1. Lolo is placed in a good company,
  2. Manoj's readiness score is below **50**, and
  3. Lolo does not have feelings for Manoj.

- `"TryAgainLater"` if:
  - Manoj is emotionally stable but doesn't meet other criteria.

- `"UndefinedLoveState"` for all other cases.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= advice.length <= 100`
- `-1 <= advice[i] <= 1`
- `0 <= readinessScore <= 100`

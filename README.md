# 💔 DSA Life Problems – `CutGya Series`

Welcome to the **CutGya-Series**, an open-source repository where **DSA meets drama**, and **LeetCode meets Lolo** 😭✨

> This repo is a tribute to all those who faced heartbreaks during placements, got ghosted after assessments, or found **Dynamic Programming more comforting than DMs** 💻❤️

---

## 🚀 What's Inside?

This repository features **emotionally relatable DSA problems** inspired by real-life situations — especially during coding placements, interviews, and unrequited love.

Each problem is structured with:
- 📄 A detailed **problem statement** in `problem.md`
- 🧪 Multiple test cases in `testcases.md`
- 💡 Optimized solutions in C++ (and soon Python)
- 🧠 Explanation + approach (Greedy / DP / Knapsack, etc.)
- ⏱️ Time and space complexity analysis

### 💔 Problem 1: [`IsTrueLovePossible`](IsTrueLovePossible/problem.md)

Can Manoj, a sincere coder, decode Lolo’s signals and determine if love is mutual?

#### 🔸 Description:
Manoj receives confusing signals (1 = positive, 0 = neutral, -1 = negative) and wants to know if **at least two encouraging signals** exist, with other criteria like readiness score and feelings.

#### 📂 Files:
- `IsTrueLovePossible/problem.md`
- `IsTrueLovePossible/solution.cpp`
- `IsTrueLovePossible/testcases.md`

### 💘 Problem 2: [`MaximizeTrueLoveByAdviceFlips`](MaximizeTrueLoveByAdviceFlips/problem.md)

Given limited energy to flip advice, can Manoj **maximize his chances of success in love** (or placement)? Uses **0/1 Knapsack DP** logic.

#### 🔸 Description:
Each person gives confusing advice to Manoj. He can flip up to `k` values to try and make it positive. If a person has at least 2 positive advices, high readiness, and feelings — then they are a valid match.

Your goal is to **maximize how many valid matches** he can make within `k` flips.

#### 📂 Files:
- `MaximizeTrueLoveByAdviceFlips/problem.md`
- `MaximizeTrueLoveByAdviceFlips/solution.cpp` (DP)
- `MaximizeTrueLoveByAdviceFlips/testcases.md`
